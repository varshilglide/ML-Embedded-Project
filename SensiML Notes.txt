SensiML:

Q: Key-Benefits of SensiML?
--> There are some benefits of SensiML:

1. Raw Signal Capture:
--> Create compact algorithms that execute on tiny IOT endpoints, not in the cloud.

2. Data Insight Labeling:
--> Collect accurate traceable, version-controlled datasets.

3. Algorithm generation:
--> Utilized advanced AutoML code-gen to quickly produce autonomous working device code.

4. Firmware code generation:
--> Choose your interface, and level of AI Expertise and retain full access to every aspect of your algorithm.

5. Test/Validation and Support:
--> Build an edge-tuning model that can customize behavior as they see more data.


Q: What is SensiML?

==> SensiML brings real-time event detection to the IoT sensing endpoint with software usable by developers regardless of AI/ML skill level.
==> Models are created using SensiML’s AutoML analytics engine that automatically generates an optimized, device-ready model maximizing accuracy within the specified resource constraints of the target hardware.

==> It is intelligent sensing AI algorithms for low-powered embedded devices.


Q: what is Data Captured Lab in SensiML?

--> Treat Your Data Like the Key Asset It Is.
--> To enable high-quality data, SensiML’s Data Capture Lab is expressly built to enable the collection, cleansing, labeling, and management of train and test datasets using a rigorous workflow supporting one too many users.

--> The Data Capture Lab is an application that helps you capture, organize, and label raw data from the sensor and transform it into the events you want to detect.

==> Data Collection:

--> A large part of building an AI application on the edge is collecting meaningful training data. The Data Capture Lab makes this easy with several useful features including:

1. Use any third-party device for real-time data collection over Serial, Bluetooth-LE, and Wi-Fi

2. Robust re-training tools on an existing AI application

3. Import sensor data (CSV or WAV) from any external source

4. Connect to a webcam in combination with your sensor data



























Good Notes:

==> For Installation: pip install SensiML

==> The integration with SensiML Analytics Studio and Google’s TensorFlow Lite for Microcontrollers provides a nice end-to-end workflow for creating IoT edge models on embedded devices
